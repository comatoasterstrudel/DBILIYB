$BEAN	testing it

$BEGINNING_1	 Hello !! Um.. I found this.. BODY on the road!
$BEGINNING_2	They’re alive.. So I decided we can inspect them for SCIENCE..
$BEGINNING_3	YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.
$BEGINNING_4	Here: you can click on things to learn more about them..
$BEGINNING_5	TRY IT NOW!!

$NERVOUS_1	This is the Nervous System! It’s kind of like the bodies control center..
$NERVOUS_2	It helps you to think, move, feel, and a LOT of other things, too!
$NERVOUS_3	The part we are looking at now, (the Central Nervous System) is made up of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and a LOT of nerves!!

$BRAIN_1	This is the brain.. It’s the culmination of your being!
$BRAIN_2	This is pretty much the most important part.. (but everything else is still important too)
$BRAIN_3	It’s what lets you control your body! It lets you think, and lots more!

$CORD_1	This is the spinal cord.. It’s a bunch of nerves that goes down your back..
$CORD_2	It lets signals go to and from your brain!!
$CORD_3	more info hahaha

$NERVOUS_OUTRO_1	Well.. that was a brief explanation of the central nervous system!!
$NERVOUS_OUTRO_2	What about the other part, the peripheral nervous system?

$PERIPHERAL_1	The peripheral nervous system consists of lots of nerves that go through the body..
$PERIPHERAL_2	The head, neck and the rest!!
$PERIPHERAL_3	It sends the signals from the central nervous system to the rest of the body..
$PERIPHERAL_4	For example.. If you need to move your arm, its because of the peripheral nerves sending the signal from your brain.. To your arms! 
$PERIPHERAL_5	Isn't that great!?!?

$STROKE_BUTTON_1	Anyway, I think we should learn about some negative things that can happen with the nervous system..
$STROKE_BUTTON_2	Click that button to simulate a stroke on our little friend here!!
$STROKE_BUTTON_3	(it wont hurt him THAT bad..)

$STROKE_1	UH OH.. IT LOOKS LIKE THEYRE HAVING A STROKE...        is what I WOULD be saying if this wasn't planned!
$STROKE_2	Erm.. for you SIMPLETONS that means that the brain is having its blood flow blocked..
$STROKE_3	It's usually caused by either a blood clot.. Or if the brain suddenly starts bleeding.. Yikes!!!
$STROKE_4	When there isn't any blood flow, the brain cells die, which stops the brains ability to function..
$STROKE_5	If you couldn’t tell.. That isn't good…
$STROKE_6	If someone is having a stroke, the best thing you can do is immediately call 911 for help..
$STROKE_7	Every moment counts, so be as fast as you can.
$STROKE_8	Luckily, we wont have to worry about that in this case, we can just click that button again to fix this..
$STROKE_9	Around 140,000 Americans die per year because of strokes..
$STROKE_10	This person will NOT be one of them..
$STROKE_11	Well, go ahead and reverse the stroke.

$END_1	AH, good, they’re okay!
$END_2	Anyway, thank you for listening to this nice presentation..
$END_3	About the nervous system..
$END_4	oh. there goes the sources I used...  I wonder where they're going..
$END_5	oh well.. Bye bye!!
